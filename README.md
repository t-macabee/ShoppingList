# Tacta_ShoppingList

Simple shopping list creator, with slight management options. Web application was created using .NET and Angular framework, therefore Visual Studio 2022, WebStorm 2022 and SQL Server was used (SQLite can be used aswell). In Visual Studio, it is necessary to check the connection string (it can be found in appsettings.json in API), and URL that Swagger uses (it can be found in environments folder in Client). Compare it and change if necessary. Execute 'update-database' command (to run premade migration with user seed data) in Packet Manager Console and change the running option to ISS Express before running the application, to match the URL that's being used. In WebStorm, it is necessary to run 'npm install' command, used to install all project dependencies.
